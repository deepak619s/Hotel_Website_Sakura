                        <p>Hot and cold dishes available at breakfast: fruits, cold meat, cheese, cereal, yogurts - as well as such expected hot foods as eggs, bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, sausages (western expectations). Plenty of bread varieties and fresh pastries. Fruit juices, tea, coffee.

                            Lunch menu a little disappointing: mostly sandwiches, burgers, salads. A good time to go and eat in the village of Franschhoek.

                            Dinner (at Dish Restaurant) is well served and of high class. Meat, fish and vegetarian dishes. Nothing particularly exciting, but all extremely well cooked, flavoured and presented. Such ingredients as Cape salmon, calamari, chicken, duck, lamb (which I found vey good), steaks; pasta, vegetables. Various desserts.

                            A good wine list (of South African wines) with a wide range of wines by the glass.

                        <h2>Housekeeping</h2>
                        <p>Housekeeping is an operational department in a hotel, which is responsible for cleanliness, maintenance, aesthetic upkeep of rooms, public area, back area and surroundings. A hotel survives on the sale of room, food, beverages and other minor services such as the laundry, health club spa and so on. The sale of rooms constituter a minimum of 50 per cent of these sales. Thus, the major part of the hotel’s margin of profit comes from the room sales, because a room once made can be sold over and over again. The effort that a housekeeping department makes in giving a guest a desirable room has a direct bearing on the guest’s experience in a hotel. Guestrooms are the heart of the hotel. The housekeeping department not only prepares clean guestroom on a timely basis for arriving guest, but also cleans and maintains everything in the hotel so that the property is as fresh and attractive as the day it opened for business. Housekeeping, thus, is an ancillary department that contributes in a big way towards the overall reputation of a property.the best housekeeper working in HOTEL YUVRAJ</p>

                         <p>We had a 3 night stay to enjoy the Prague Christmas Markets, and were very satisfied with every aspect of the hotel. The staff are very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable regarding places to visit in Prague. The hotel is very clean throughout, and our room was spacious with everything that we needed. Breakfast was substantial, and suited all tastes. The hotel is quiet, and is situated near to numerous restaurants, and a main supermarket, and within easy walking distance from the Christmas Markets. We would highly recommend a stay at this hotel.</p>

                        <p>It was a good stay! The food was excellent and the staff superb! There was a staff member who was particularly helpful, accommodating and shared his knowledge about Prague with us. Unfortunately I did not get his name but it appeared he assisted the front desk and also carried our luggage to our room.</p>
